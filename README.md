# UFOs
Module 11: UFO Sightings with JavaScript
## Overview of Project
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, I’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
To use the UFO Sightings webpage, you have to type fullfil the boxes which are the filters that are going to allow you to make a more specific search. After typing the characteristics, you have to press enter and wait for the results. Finally, to reset the filter criteria, click the UFO Sightings at the top left of the website.

## Summary

- It is necessary to fulfill the filters with lower-case and no spaces
